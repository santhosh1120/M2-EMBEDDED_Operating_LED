# Introduction
   The blinking  LED's circuit is like the electronics version of the “Hello World”-program. It’s a simple electronic circuit that gives you a visual cue if it works. It was the first circuit I ever built, and it felt GREAT!. The Project is developed in C language. The concept of blinking LED's is similar to the blinking of a single LED. As we know, we can use the resistance of any value, so let's take the resistors of 330 Ohms. The resistors reduce the amount of current reaching the LED, which saves the LED from being burnt.

# Objective
   The main objective is to blink the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
# Components used
1.ATmega328   

2.Two LED 

3.Switch

4.Resistor
# software used
1.simulIDe

2.Visual Studie Code

# Features
   It has simple features.
       
     1.LED will pass current in its forward direction but block the flow of current in the reverse direction.
    2.It can switch on the LED's when switch is in on state.
# 4W's and 1 H's
   ## Why:
    1.To blink two LED's using a switch in ATmega328.
    2.Long Life.
   ## Where:
    1. It can be used anywhere.
    2. It can be used for understanding purposes in educational and practical purposes .
   ## Who:
    1.It can be used by students.
    2.It can be used by anyone who are new to embedded programming language.
   ## When:
    1.People get an exposure of embedded programming language.
    2.In schools and colleges it can be implemented.
   ## How
    1.By using softwares to exceute the program.
    2.By loading the program in ATmega328.
# SWOT Analysis
   ## Strengths
    1. program is simple to understand.
    2.Cost is low .
   ## Weakness
    1.program is basic.
   ## Opportunities
    1.Apart from those informations that are mentioned above in the objectives, you can also use your ideas how to take this project to next level by adding more informations        like: Blinking all the LED's by using atmega328 etc..,
   ## Threats
    1.There are many programming language which are already exist and are easy to learn .
